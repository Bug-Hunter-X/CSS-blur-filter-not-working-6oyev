# CSS Blur Filter Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue where the CSS `filter: blur()` property fails to apply a blur effect to an element.  The provided `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a corrected version and explanation.

**Problem:** The blur filter is applied, but no visible blur effect is observed. This could be caused by several factors, including incorrect element styling or conflicting CSS rules.

**Solution:** The solution often involves checking for conflicting styles, ensuring the element is rendered correctly and has visible content, or adjusting the blur radius.

This example highlights a simple solution, but similar issues might require more in-depth debugging to uncover the root cause.
