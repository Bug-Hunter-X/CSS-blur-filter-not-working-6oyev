The issue is likely due to a missing or conflicting style in another part of the CSS. If the element is not visible, a blur effect is not applicable. Try adding a visible background color to check if the element is present. To fix, ensure the element is visible and the `filter: blur()` is applied correctly without other overlapping styles that cancel out the effect. For instance, ensure that the element has a defined width and height, and there's no `opacity: 0` that masks the effect.

```css
/* bug.css */
.blurred-element {
  filter: blur(5px);
  /* Add some other style so the element is visible */
  background-color: red;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

/* bugSolution.css */
.blurred-element {
  filter: blur(5px);
  background-color: red;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```
